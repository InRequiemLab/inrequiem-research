Trends
Ranges


Recognizing these early on and adjusting our trading strategy to them is one of the most important things to do. Trading ranges and trends require almost diametrically different approaches. But before we go into that, let’s cover some basics and demonstrate how they look.

**Trends**

Simply put, the trend is when the price is going either up or down. To give this more technical explanation, an uptrend is represented by higher highs and higher lows. If we look at the chart that shows higher highs and higher lows, we can see that lows and highs are made by a pattern of three candlesticks next to each other.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278a4368-edf5-4e7d-80d0-72bc026ff00f)


These are called swing highs and swing lows.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa39c429-17ce-4f9d-b1d8-fb7ec90ac9df)


A swing low is made when the price makes a low on the second candle, and the first and third candles are not exceeding that low. The same goes for swing high, which is made when the price makes high on the second candle, and the first and third candles are not exceeding that high.  So as we can see in this example of an uptrend, when the price slows down and creates a pullback lower, a swing low is made, and the price moves higher.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/906b5a78-3749-4a94-b8e6-dc4273d7c00d)


Lower lows and lower highs represent a downtrend.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef177fc7-d3aa-489b-995b-bdf979e27717)

In a downtrend, we look for short-term rallies that create swing highs, which usually offer an opportunity to sell.

When are trends changing?

If we are in an uptrend and the last swing low that lets to a highest high is broken, we can consider a trend change or at least a pause.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccbad609-a9a1-4ab0-8432-6840a6389a0f)

The same goes for the downtrend, if the last swing high, which lets the lowest low, is broken, we can look for buying opportunities or at least a slowing down. Although these examples look very straightforward, things are more complicated in real markets. Swing highs and lows are often violated, yet the price continues in its direction. There are several reasons why this might happen, and it is something that we will cover in future videos. In a trending market, we can use different indicators to help us stay in the trends. The most popular ones are moving averages, Ichimoku cloud, and MACD, and they are used for building different trend following strategies.

**Ranges**

In ranging markets, price is bouncing between specific highs and lows. The high is acting as resistance and the low is acting as support.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/920cc7b1-3ff6-4b0f-acfb-f3cd0cd3aa2c)


Ranging markets are also called sideways or bracketing markets. When we are in the ranging markets, we are not looking to capture moves but rather use mean-reverting strategies. Mean-reverting strategies work on the assumption that the underlying asset will eventually return to the mean once it deviates from it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00934bab-c289-42d6-99b5-912b72ca07cc)


Our mean can be anything, from moving average, volume-weighted average price, or price level. From this mean, we calculate standard deviations. Once the price reaches those standard deviations, we can bet on a return to the mean. The problem with mean-reverting strategies is that the market can start trending, and we will get caught on the wrong side of the market. One of the most popular mean-reverting indicators is Bollinger Bands, RSI or stochastic. So is it better to follow trends or mean-reverting? That is up to you and our personal preference. In general, markets are more ranging than trending, but a lot of money can be made in huge trends.

## What is Supply and demand trading?
Supply and demand trading is a price action-based trading strategy that is similar to horizontal support and resistance. It is based on the fundamental dynamics of supply and demand, which influence financial markets just as they do in the broader economy.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e4081f-6d5b-45a6-839f-83f9723d84f4)

## How to trade Supply and demand
For example, Apple released a new iPhone, but this time it would be a special edition with limited devices to sell. There will be a lot of buyers or demand who will drive prices higher. On the other hand, if Apple released a new iPhone with unlimited pieces to sell and got bad reviews, there would be an enormous supply to sell but no demand to buy. Because of that, they will have to drive prices lower until they find buyers willing to buy. This is the same in financial markets where prices rise once aggressive buyers overcome sellers; in other words, demand overcomes supply. Or vice versa when aggressive sellers overcome buyers or supply overcome demand. One of the common misconceptions many traders assume is that when markets move quickly in one direction, it is because there are more buyers than sellers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a20a5025-1d82-4e0e-b330-40b14572d01c)

This is not true since for every buyer there has to be a seller and vice versa. When the price goes up or down, there is no supremacy on either side, but the amount of aggressivity or willingness to buy or sell for higher or lower prices. If we look at this idea from a more advanced perspective, traders can place two types of orders in the market.

**Limit orders and market orders**

Let’s say we have an instrument that is priced at $100 and there are limit orders above and below the price.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4515708-b378-4dd4-a071-fe7a64c4ce02)

At 101 we have 5 limits orders to sell, at 102 we have 10 orders to sell. Below the price, there is 5 to buy at 99 and 10 to buy at 98. For the market to move higher or lower there has to be someone who will buy 5 contracts to move to 101 and 15 contracts to move the price to 102. If aggressive buyers want to move prices higher, the limit sellers above the price start to pull their orders from the order book, and the price will keep climbing higher. When there is obvious aggressivity from either side, supply and demand zones are created. If we want to understand why these zones give us trading opportunities, we have to think about who moves the markets. We, as retail traders, do not move markets. The institutions, banks, and large funds do move markets. Compared to us, these market participants cannot just execute their orders wherever they want. They need enough liquidity in the order books not to get significant slippage. That is why they use areas of consolidation for entering the market. More often than not, they cannot execute all orders at once, so when prices drive away from the consolidation zone, they still have unfilled orders inside. That is why markets often react once zones are revisited.

**How to identify supply and demand zones**

If we want to identify supply and demand zones, we have to look at consolidations before the large expansions. The demand zones are found in consolidations before a large move up. The supply zones are found in consolidations before the large move down. The larger and more aggressive the move, the more significant Supply or Demand zone is.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80dafff1-4085-42f3-83a3-35dbde82c501)

**What makes a good supply and demand zone**

Besides a large move from the zone, we look for a few other factors that give us confluence for trades. Zones on higher time frames will always carry more value than those on lower time frames.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8b2a85e-11f5-46ba-a425-b3903172c16d)

The time market spends outside of the zone is also necessary; we don’t want to see the market being crazy all over the place going back and forth.

What we prefer to see is a nice rounded retest into the zone.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bdfbed-1643-4db0-a8b5-c59d7a7244f9)


**How to trade supply and demand zones**

There are two ways to trade supply and demand zones, first one is a set and forget approach when we put a limit order at the top of the demand zone or bottom of the supply zone. This gives us more freedom from looking at charts, but of course, we might get quickly taken out when the price spikes through the zone.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de4b586b-8e79-42bc-b75e-5062b80b93aa)

The second approach is to wait for the initial reaction and enter with a market order. Our stop loss should always go to the other side of the zone, and we can target the next supply or demand zone or support and resistance area. Entering the market is entirely up to our approach, and we should test what suits our trading style best.

# Fibonacci 

## Fibonacci retracements
The Fibonacci retracements are one of the most popular tools in technical analysis. They came up from the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. These are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144… If we divide two numbers next to each other from number three and above, we will gain a certain ratio we can use from Fibonacci retracement levels. Fibonacci retracement levels can then be used as horizontal support and resistance areas. And they are created by using a Fibonacci retracement tool which is available with pretty much every trading software and plotting it from key swing highs and swing lows. Once we plot those, we will see 23.6, 38.2, .50, 61.8, and 100% retracement numbers.

Why do these numbers work? 

There is no magic behind that; it is simply because dozens of traders watch them, so we tend to see a reaction once the price reaches them. The most important ones are 38.2, 50 and 61.8% retracement levels. The 61.8% retracement is also called the golden ratio, and it is the most important one. A 50% retracement is not technically a Fibonacci number, but it is used because it works.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f4e3556-5327-483f-acbd-1f22ff6035cb)

As we can see on this chart, this is a daily EURUSD chart where we plotted a Fibonacci retracement tool on key swing highs and swing lows.  Once the price starts its retracement, we could find a buying opportunity between 61,8 and 50% retracement. Another way of using Fibonacci numbers is with a Fibonacci extension.
Fibonacci extension

This Fibonacci extension can predict future support and resistance levels in trending markets. This extension tool is pulled from major swing moves, and it is beneficial with instruments in price discovery. In other words, instruments that are beyond their previous all-time high.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b9da571-e6c4-413b-8f3f-330c5134b17c)

If we take this NASDAQ chart, we can see that the Fibonacci extension was pulled from the whole 2020 March crash. It could show us important levels of support and resistance in play after NASDAQ broke its all-time high. In conclusion, Fibonacci retracement and extension can be useful, but it is not the holy grail in trading. These levels oftentimes get front-run or broken through, so practising good risk management is always the key.

# Divergence trading

## What is divergence trading?

Divergence trading is a technique for identifying potential market reversals by comparing price action with oscillators like RSI or MACD. When the price reaches higher highs or lower lows that aren’t mirrored by the oscillator, it indicates a divergence, signalling a possible trend change.

Many traders struggle to predict market reversals, as prices don’t always follow simple patterns. That’s where divergence trading can help. There is a popular saying in trading that all we have to do to be profitable is to buy low and sell high. Unfortunately, in real trading, things are rarely easy like that. Although we will hardly sell the absolute top or buy the absolute bottom, we can use divergences to spot possible reversals very early and also use them to manage our existing positions.

In this lesson, we will take a closer look at what is divergence in trading and how to work with it.

**Divergence in Trading: Identifying Trends with Indicators**

The divergence can be spotted by comparing price action with different oscillators. When the market is going up, and the price is making a higher high or going down, the price makes a lower low, the indicator should also make higher highs and lower lows. But when there is a divergence, we can see that an uptrend price is making higher highs, and the indicator is making lower lows. Same for a downtrend, the price is making lower lows, but the indicator is making higher highs. It is up to us what indicator we decide to use.

The most popular ones are RSI, MACD or Stochastics.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247c2d39-e0f8-463a-b9d6-2f0e79a1da2a)

Compared to indicators such as moving averages or Bollinger Bands which are lagging indicators, divergences are considered a leading indicator. This means that we can catch reversals near-absolute tops and bottoms and get great risk to reward setups.

Sounds great, right?

It is great, but like anything in trading,  divergence trading is not some hidden secret to the markets. We will often find out that divergences appear in strong trends, but the price is still going in one direction. This is why divergences are best to use once the market slows down after a strong directional move where we can spot a weakening momentum. There are two types of divergence: Regular and hidden.

**Regular divergence**

Regular divergences are used for possible trend reversals. There is a bullish and bearish regular divergence.

What is a bullish divergence? The bullish divergence can be spotted when the price makes lower lows, but the oscillator makes higher lows. This can be a possible signal of a downtrend reversal. As we can see in the example, a price makes lower lows that are not confirmed on the MACD indicator; therefore, we can look for a trend reversal.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b20db731-1674-4f86-97e9-fe65139bbb21)

Opposite to that is a regular bearish divergence. When the price is making higher highs, but the oscillator makes lower highs, we can spot the regular bearish divergence. This can be a signal of a reversal in an uptrend. As we can see in the example, a new high in price is not represented by a new high in the oscillator, in this case, the RSI.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20acf960-bb9d-48e6-8b84-86598c5dbb91)

After spotting a regular divergence, we don’t need to always jump right in the trade.  More often than not, the better choice is to wait for other confirmations like watching a price action or technical indicators.

**What is a hidden divergence?**

Compared to regular divergences, hidden divergence can signal possible trend reversals and a trend continuation. As trend trading can oftentimes be easier than trying to catch tops and bottoms, hidden divergence is a useful tool we can use. A hidden bullish divergence can be found in an uptrend.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c36901ec-6a6d-4a94-97ef-bd3b3090a930)

We can spot a hidden bullish divergence when the price makes a higher low and the oscillator makes a lower low. Hidden bearish divergence is presented when the price makes a lower high and the oscillator makes a higher high. Here is the recap of what we learned in today’s lesson, as we can see on the table.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3246cdd7-2374-44ca-8305-2516cb4031a4)

Regular divergences are useful for trend reversals, and hidden divergences can signal trend continuation. It is always well advised to use other trading confluence tools rather than just trading these divergences blindly.  We can use anything from indicators or price action.

# RSI: Technical Indicator
Want to know exactly when to enter or exit your trades? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) helps traders pinpoint the perfect moment for trading reversals. Created by J. Welles Wilder in 1978, RSI quickly became one of the most popular technical indicators due to its simplicity and effectiveness across all trading timeframes.

## What is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?

RSI is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure overbought and oversold market conditions. It compares the magnitude and speed of recent price changes to identify potential price reversals or trend continuations.

## RSI Formula and Calculation Explained

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is calculated using the following formula:

RSI(n) = 100 – [100 / (1 + U(n) / D(n))]

Where:

- U(n) represents the average gain over the selected number of periods.
- D(n) represents the average decline over the same number of periods.

**How to Calculate U(n) and D(n)**
To calculate D(n), sum all the declines over the selected period (commonly 14 periods) and divide by that number of periods. Similarly, U(n) is calculated by adding up all the gains over the same period and dividing by the number of periods.

This calculation gives a clear measure of market strength by comparing average gains and declines, making the RSI a useful tool for analysing market momentum.

## How RSI works?
RSI measures the momentum of price movements, identifying whether an asset is potentially overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30). The indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, clearly visualising market conditions.

**RSI Key Value Ranges**
- RSI below 30: If the RSI shows a value of 30 or less on its scale, the market might be in an oversold condition, meaning a dominance of sellers in the market, which can lead to the absorption or exhaustion of sellers, and in both cases, it is a buy signal. You can spot this on the chart in the form of a structure change to long.
- RSI between 30 and 70: This is also called the neutral zone, where the market is neither overbought or oversold. Traders may interpret this range as a zone of consolidation or indecision in the market, waiting for a clear trend to emerge before making a trading decision.
- RSI above 70: At the value of 70, the RSI indicates an overbought condition and could possibly reverse.

## What is the Best Setting for RSI?

There is no best RSI setting, but an important factor in choosing one is your trading style. Different trading styles require different types of settings, and here are some of the most commonly used:

- Day trading: 10-14 periods, lines 80 for overbought and 20 for oversold
- Swing trading: 14 periods, 70 overbought, and 30 oversold
- Scalping: 5-7 periods, 90 overbought, and 10 oversold

## How to Use RSI in Trading

**RSI as a buy and sell indicator**
This is the easiest way to implement RSI into your strategy. This method is based on monitoring the RSI level, which shows us overbought and oversold conditions specifically at 30 and 70. It works well as a confirmation on entries or to determine trade directions, but it should not be used as a standalone technical analysis tool due to its inaccuracy. Enhance your win rate by experimenting with additional indicators such as VWAP or MACD, or by combining them with other tools like Fibonacci levels, market structure, and others in conjunction with the Relative Strength Index.

RSI buy signal example

Enter the trade if the RSI hits or falls below the 30 level.

RSI sell signal example

Same as with a buy signal, wait for it to hit 70, or if it gets below 70.

**How to trade RSI divergence**
The use of divergence is also very popular among traders. It is based on the comparison of price and RSI development. If the price is rising and reaching new highs and the RSI is falling, this could signal the beginning of a downward trend, known as bearish divergence. Conversely, bullish divergence occurs when the price decreases but the RSI increases, signalling a potential price increase. We can use divergence to determine the trend direction or trade entries.

Buy signal example

When a bullish divergence is formed and subsequently the price chart starts going in the same direction as the RSI, it is an entry signal.

Sell signal example

After a bearish divergence, we wait for the confluence of both the RSI and price action charts and then enter the trade.

## Limitations and risks of RSI

- RSI in strong trends

RSI works better in some market conditions than in others. This indicator just excels in less volatile markets where its signals are more accurate, then in high volatility with economic news or strong trends, it has a problem with precision and often tends to be at the extreme values.

- No volume included

Another disadvantage is that it is also not based on the volume of trades, which is a key factor in technical analysis where it helps traders to see support and resistance zones.

- Lack of context

RSI is very difficult to use without using other technical analysis tools because the indicator tends to produce false signals when market conditions change. Thus, it is advisable not to rely solely on RSI but to use it as a complementary tool in your overall trading strategy.

## Key Takeaways
- The relative strength index is a popular technical indicator among traders.
- RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder and is a versatile tool applicable across all timeframes and known for its simplicity.
- It ranges on a scale of 0-100 and has two significant zones, namely 70, which indicates an overbought condition, and 30, which indicates an oversold condition of a given market.
- The use of this indicator can be different, for example, to determine entries or trade directions and possible reversals.
- Despite its strengths, RSI has its weaknesses, especially when trading in highly volatile markets, where the indicator produces an increased amount of false signals and often goes to extremes, but the trend can continue. Therefore, it is advisable to consider using other technical tools in addition to RSI.
- Traders should view RSI as a supporting component rather than the sole basis of their strategies.

# How to spot breakouts and fakeouts

## Trading breakouts and fakeouts

Breakout trading is a popular trading strategy followed by many traders and trading algorithms. There are two ways you can spot a breakout, the first one is by using price action, and the second is by using technical indicators that measure volatility.

What is volatility? 

Volatility measures price fluctuations over certain time periods. When there is high volatility, markets go back and forth very quickly; when there is low volatility, markets are trading in tight ranges. During times of low volatility, we can expect breakouts to occur. Bollinger Bands, Keltner or Donchian Channels are the most popular indicators to measure volatility. They measure volatility based on different indicators such as moving averages or Average true range. Another way of looking at volatility is by using price action. You can use horizontal support and resistance or different chart patterns to spot a possible breakout. Breakout trading can be considered an impatient approach as breakout traders often use stop or market orders to chase rising volatility.

This can work, but very often, we can see false breaks above and below existing ranges. These false breaks happen for one simple reason, above and below every easily recognizable price range, you can find two types of orders. If we take a look at an example of horizontal resistance, which was already tested in the past, above it, we can find stop-loss orders from traders who are already short and also buy stop orders from traders that are anticipating a breakout.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b9553a2-0ca9-4701-b337-8a3917b3a67a)

Because both of these essentially buy orders, they bring a large amount of liquidity, in other words resting orders, to the market. Large market participants often use this liquidity and absorb all the buy orders with their large sells. This will result in a false breakout above the resistance and continuation down. Not becoming a victim of these false breakouts is not that hard; all you need to do is not put your stop-loss to obvious places where there is a high likelihood of other traders having their stop-loss. Another thing is trying to have a little more patient approach rather than having a “fear of missing out”, and after you see a breakout outside of any tight range, wait to see if new prices will be accepted or not.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58cc8685-eb4c-4211-8f6a-eed40d08d1b8)

Of course, there will be situations where you will miss out on the breakout, but more often than not, waiting for the breakout and placing a limit order to an area where the breakout occurred can be a smarter play.
